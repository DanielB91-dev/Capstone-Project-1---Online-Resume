    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Results-driven sales professional with over a decade of experience, now settled back in Melbourne permanently after immigrating from the United Kingdom. Passionate about returning to a quota-carrying role to leverage my experience and proven track record in driving revenue growth, exceeding targets, and developing strong customer relationships. After 5 years of scaling SDR teams in high-growth companies, I'm eager to leverage my unique insights from purchasing and implementing B2B applications, along with my ability to build high-quality pipeline that leads to net new logos.</p>
